# Singapore geo-referenced radar images

This is an old project to collect, geo-reference and store radar images from NEA Singapre. As the project not goes on well, the collection service is not working very well recently. Thus, I move the collection process here, and update these images to this repository.

The collection is done on a Raspberry Pi. The update freqency can be as high as 5 minutes, and normal delay is within 7 minutes. To reduce the number of commits, the images are commited every 6 hours.
